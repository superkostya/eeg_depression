# Assignment:

Suppose that based on previous medical research, scientists have found that changes over time in electrophysiological biomarkers can be very useful in predicting depression. Here we have an artificial hospital dataset obtained from patients with their basic demographic information (age and medical history) as well as information extracted from two sessions (recorded at appropriately spaced time points) of brain wave recordings (EEG). We rename the EEG features to greek letters plus the channel name (5 channels for each feature).
